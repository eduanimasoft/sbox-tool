# Welcome message
Dear stranger,

I am Ing. Stanislav Marochok, and I am happy to welcome you in this repository. 

I am the author of the whole code, but I am not the author of the "Prescribed DDT" generation method implemented within this project. The author of the method is prof. Pavol Zajac and I have just implemented the algorithm.

If you have any questions, improvements, advices, or just want to talk, write me a mail [ssssstas30@gmail.com](mailto:ssssstas30@gmail.com) - this is my personal mail.
